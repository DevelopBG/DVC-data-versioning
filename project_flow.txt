1. create a git repo and clone it locally
2. create a file code.py and add code to it. ( it will save a csv file to a new)
3. push it into git.
4. pip instal dvc
5. dvc init ( creates .dvcignore, .dvc)
6. make a dir of s3 ( mkdir S3- linux command), considering an aws s3 bucket, later we will see the aws integration 
7. New we do "dvc remote add -d myromote S3" : to tell dvc which one is remote origin. 
8. Next "dvc add data/" 
   >Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   >Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle. 
9. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
